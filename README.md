# SimpleLinearRegression
Simple Project for Beginners . In this project we are going to predict percentage of marks based on the number of hours of study 


Building Simple Project using Linear Regression
In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables. Note : In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

## Importing all libraries required in this notebook
- import pandas as pd
- import numpy as np  
- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
- %matplotlib inline
## Reading data from remote link
- url = "http://bit.ly/w-data"
- s_data = pd.read_csv(url)
- print("Data imported successfully")

- s_data.head(10)
### Output
Data imported successfully
Hours	Scores
0	2.5	21
1	5.1	47
2	3.2	27
3	8.5	75
4	3.5	30
5	1.5	20
6	9.2	88
7	5.5	60
8	8.3	81
9	2.7	25
Let's plot our data points on 2-D graph to eyeball our dataset and see if we can manually find any relationship between the data. We can create the plot with the following script:

## Plotting the distribution of scores
- s_data.plot(x='Hours', y='Scores', style='o')  
- plt.title('Hours vs Percentage')  
- plt.xlabel('Hours Studied')  
- plt.ylabel('Percentage Score')  
- plt.show()
## Plotting the distribution of scores
- s_data.plot(x='Hours', y='Scores', style='o')  
- plt.title('Hours vs Percentage')  
- plt.xlabel('Hours Studied')  
- plt.ylabel('Percentage Score')  
- plt.show()
### *Note*
From the graph above, we can clearly see that there is a positive linear relation between the number of hours studied and percentage of score.

Preparing the data
The next step is to divide the data into "attributes" (inputs) and "labels" (outputs).

- X = s_data.iloc[:, :-1].values  
- y = s_data.iloc[:, 1].values  
- X = s_data.iloc[:, :-1].values  
- y = s_data.iloc[:, 1].values  
Now that we have our attributes and labels, the next step is to split this data into training and test sets. We'll do this by using Scikit-Learn's built-in train_test_split() method:

- from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  
- X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y,test_size=0.2, random_state=0) 
- from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  
- X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y,test_size=0.2, random_state=0) 
### Training the Algorithm
We have split our data into training and testing sets, and now is finally the time to train our algorithm.

- from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression  
- regressor = LinearRegression()  
- regressor.fit(X_train, y_train) 

- print("Training completed...")
-from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression  
- regressor = LinearRegression()  
- regressor.fit(X_train, y_train) 
​
- print("Training completed...")
### Output :
Training completed...
## Plotting the regression line
- line = regressor.coef_*X+regressor.intercept_

## Plotting for the test data
- plt.scatter(X, y)
- plt.plot(X, line);
- plt.show()
## Plotting the regression line
- line = regressor.coef_*X+regressor.intercept_
​
## Plotting for the test data
- plt.scatter(X, y)
- plt.plot(X, line);
- plt.show()

## Making Predictions
Now that we have trained our algorithm, it's time to make some predictions.

- print(X_test) # Testing data - In Hours
- y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test) # Predicting the scores
- print(X_test) # Testing data - In Hours
- y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test) # Predicting the scores
### Output :
[[1.5]
 [3.2]
 [7.4]
 [2.5]
 [5.9]]
## Comparing Actual vs Predicted
- df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test, 'Predicted': y_pred})  
- #df 
## Comparing Actual vs Predicted
- df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test, 'Predicted': y_pred})  
- #df 
### Output :
Actual	Predicted
0	20	16.884145
1	27	33.732261
2	69	75.357018
3	30	26.794801
4	62	60.491033
## You can also test with your own data
- hours = 9.25
- own_pred = regressor.predict([[hours]])
- print("No of Hours = {}".format(hours))
- print("Predicted Score = {}".format(own_pred[0]))

### Output :
No of Hours = 9.25
Predicted Score = 93.69173248737538
## Evaluating the model
The final step is to evaluate the performance of algorithm. This step is particularly important to compare how well different algorithms perform on a particular dataset. For simplicity here, we have chosen the mean square error. There are many such metrics.

- from sklearn import metrics  
- print('Mean Absolute Error:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)) 
- from sklearn import metrics  
- print('Mean Absolute Error:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)) 
### Output :
Mean Absolute Error: 4.183859899002975
